# zoetrope — Architecture & Principles

This document captures the *why* — the invariants, the recurring principles, and
the derived-state heuristics that hold the system together. [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md)
is the structural spec (module map, transcript format, type shapes); this is the
reasoning that governs how those pieces are allowed to behave.

The whole program solves one hard problem:

> Reconstruct a faithful, navigable, live-or-replayed picture of a coding-agent
> session (Claude Code, Codex, pi) from an **undocumented, append-only, partially-timestamped,
> multi-file** transcript — in which **completion is frequently unknowable**.

Almost every design decision below is downstream of that one sentence.

---

## 0. The provider boundary

Every transcript format enters through one seam. A **provider**
(`src/provider/<name>/`) turns its own records into the shared vocabulary in
`src/fact.rs`, and `SessionModel` folds `Fact`s without knowing which format
stated them. The rule that decides what belongs on which side:

> **A provider states what its records contain. The core decides what it means
> when nothing was recorded.**

So a provider never concludes. It emits `ToolEnd` only from a record that
carries an outcome, never synthesised from silence; it emits `Ended` only when
the format recorded the agent's end; it knows which tool names spawn agents and
says so with a `Spawn` fact, but never says an agent is done because a tool
result came back. Reasoning about *absence* — the ack-vs-completion join (§2.1),
time-derived liveness (§4), group rollup — lives in the core once, and survives
every format.

Four consequences worth knowing before touching either side:

- **Every fact carries the same envelope** (`agent`, `ts`). Activity tracking
  and undated-item dating (`Timing`) read the envelope, so neither needs to know
  a record kind. A line that states nothing else still states `Activity`.
- **A record has a time; its facts have their own.** A provider emits one
  `Statement` per record: where the file wrote it, plus what it said. The
  timeline places the record; the fold reads each fact's time. So a completion
  record that also says when its call started keeps the tool's duration right
  without inventing a timeline position the file never had (§1.2).
- **An agent exists once it has spoken.** Facts *by* an agent create its node;
  facts *about* one (`Label`, `Ended`) only record until it appears. That is the
  order-independence of §1.1 stated as a creation rule.
- **What a format's quirks mean is the provider's to know, with a fixture to
  prove it.** "A missing `is_error` means success" is a fact about Claude's
  format, verified against real data; it lives in `provider/claude/`, not in
  the model. A new provider proves itself by running its own fixture through
  `provider::harness::conform`: order invariance (§1.1) plus two golden files
  beside the fixture, the folded model and the dated timeline, which double as
  the readable record of what that provider extracts.

The same rule holds one level up, for finding files rather than reading them
([DISCOVERY.md](DISCOVERY.md)):

> **A provider states what a file is. The core decides what a session is.**

A provider answers questions about single paths in its own layout (`all_paths`,
`session_file`, `related_paths`, `project_key`, `stream_for`, `sidecar`), and
the core assembles sessions, resolves ids, diffs rescans and tails, once. Two
consequences: the provider is read off a file's content, never its path or
extension; and any file of a session opens the session, since every format
seen names the root from every file of it.

Adding a provider is one directory and no decisions: `src/provider/mod.rs`
spells out the three files, the primitives, where fixtures go, and the one
test to pass.

---

## 1. The two ground rules

### 1.1 Order-independence (the fold model)

The derived `SessionModel` is a **pure function of the set of facts folded into
it — never of their arrival order.** Every update is *idempotent* (re-applying a
line is a no-op) and *commutative* (two updates reach the same state in either
order). The completion/spawn joins are keyed stores (`completed_calls`,
`ended`, `labels`) precisely so a fact can arrive before *or* after the thing it
refers to and still attach; prompt/era attribution is likewise
arrival-order independent — timestamp-derived (`prompt_for_ts` over the `prompts`
list), not a join store.

Why this is non-negotiable — three independent consumers demand it:

- **Multi-file merge.** A provider may spread one session over several files
  (Claude: main transcript, `subagents/*.jsonl`, workflow `journal.jsonl`). They
  are tailed separately and interleave by timestamp; an agent's ending can be
  read before its birth.
- **Backward seek.** Folding is forward-only, so seeking into the past re-folds
  the model from `items[0..target]` from a **snapshot ladder** rung when one is
  available, from item zero when it is not. Either way it must land on exactly
  the state that playing there would have.
- **Live vs replay.** The same items arrive as a bulk sorted `Vec` (replay) or as
  arrival-order appends (live). Both must converge.

Guarded by a **shuffle-invariance property test** over the fact stream: fold
what the provider states in bulk order and in many shuffled orders; the final
model must be identical.

### The snapshot ladder

A rung every `SNAPSHOT_STRIDE` folded items, so a backward seek re-folds at most
a stride instead of the whole prefix. Cloning a rung is O(1): `SessionModel` is
built from persistent (`imbl`) collections, so a rung shares structure with its
neighbours rather than copying the model. Invariants:

- **A rung holds fold state only.** Liveness and group rollups are
  projections *of the playhead*, not facts about the prefix, and are meaningless
  at a different one. Every restore re-derives them through `resync`. This is
  the fold/projection split above, applied to snapshots.
- **Every fold path goes through `drop_stale_rungs`.** Item indices are not
  stable: a late batch that dates a previously-`Pending` item re-sorts the list
  and shifts every index around it, which would silently repoint a rung at a
  different prefix. `Timeline::generation` marks that a re-sort happened and
  `take_disturbance` reports how much of the prefix it provably left alone, so
  rungs below that line are re-stamped and the rest discarded.
- **A backward seek patches the canvas, it does not rebuild it.** Seeking back
  can only *remove* agents: a fold never un-spawns one the earlier prefix
  already had, and `sync` adds and updates but never removes. So `OrdMap::diff`
  names the departed agents and only those nodes come off. Node positions, the
  viewport and the selection are never disturbed, which is why nothing has to be
  captured and restored around the seek.

**Corollary — derived state is never monotonic.** A rollup that concluded "done"
must *revert* when a contradicting fact (a late child, resumed activity) arrives.
Derived state is a function of the current fact set, never of derivation history.

### 1.2 Two clocks: content-time and presentation-time

Every time-varying quantity belongs to exactly one of two clocks, and confusing
them is the single most common bug we hit this session.

| | **Content-time** (media / playhead) | **Presentation-time** (wall / watch) |
|---|---|---|
| Also called | `cursor`, the playhead, "now-reference" | watch-time |
| Advances by | the session's own timestamps | real seconds, **only while playing** |
| Frozen when | never — it *is* the position | paused, scrubbed, or off the live edge |
| Governs | folding, liveness, pending state, dating, run **grouping** | animation: camera glide, chip **afterglow**, marching ants |
| Question it answers | "what is *true* at this moment of the session?" | "how long have *I been watching* this?" |

Two rules fall out, and they are the spine of the whole UI:

1. **State is read from content-time.** What's true (an agent's status, a tool's
   pending-ness, a run's membership) is a function of timestamped events / the
   current fact set at the playhead. It is reconstructable at any playhead,
   scrubbed to from any direction.
2. **Animation ages in presentation-time.** A fade, a glide, a pulse is *how long
   you've watched*, so it accrues only while playing and freezes when you pause or
   scrub. It is forward-only and is **not** replayed on a seek.

The failures this prevents, both of which we lived through:

- **Aging state in wall-time** → a chip's fade racing gap-compression, flickering
  as the playhead jumps. (Fixed by making the afterglow watch-time.)
- **Deriving state from a static/final record that folds early** → the
  `meta.stoppedByUser` bug: a *final* flag applied at the *start* of replay marked
  agents "stopped" for the whole session. **Time comes from timestamped events,
  never from a record that states the end but folds at the beginning.**

---

## 2. Ground truth vs derived state

Because completion is often unknowable, the model constantly fills gaps with
**derived state**. The discipline that keeps this honest is one sentence:

> **Derive only where no ground truth exists, and never let a derivation override
> ground truth sitting in the model.**

Violating the second half is exactly the class of bug this session hunted down.

### 2.1 The async-agent completion model

The most dangerous piece of "ground truth" is the one that *looks* like a
completion but isn't:

- The **`Agent` tool result is a spawn acknowledgment** — literally
  `"Async agent launched successfully"` — **NOT** a completion. The subagent then
  runs for minutes in its own sidechain transcript. Marking it done at the ack was
  the root cause of the entire chip-flicker saga.
- Likewise a **`Workflow` tool result** is `"Workflow launched in background…"` —
  a launch ack, never a completion. Workflow groups roll up from children instead.

The signals that *are* authoritative, and set the **`terminal`** flag (which pins
an agent against time-derived revival):

- A **non-superseded** spawn ack (a *sync* subagent: the ack timestamp is not
  older than the agent's last activity — see the soft spot in §3).
- A workflow **journal `result`** entry naming the agent.
- A **`<task-notification>`** — the timestamped terminal report for a background
  agent (`stopped` / `completed` / `failed`).

Both of the latter reach the model as one thing: an `Ended` fact stated by the
Claude provider, recorded in the `ended` store where it outranks the
acknowledgement and time-derived liveness. The provider knows which records are
endings; the model only knows an ending when it sees one.

`meta.stoppedByUser` is a *static final* flag and is **not** used as a completion
time — see §1.2.

### 2.2 A pending tool_call *is* ground truth

An unresolved (`Pending`) tool_call is **direct evidence the agent is working** —
strictly stronger than any "no output for N seconds" inference. This is the lesson
of the 2m22s `Bash`: the subagent produced no transcript output for 143s, the
quiet-time heuristic declared it "Done," and its in-flight indicator vanished —
and when the tool finally **errored**, that error was never shown, because the run
had already been written off as history. Both liveness (§4) and chips (§5) now
read the pending tool_call as the working signal it is.

---

## 3. The derived-state heuristics catalogue

These are the places the model computes agent/timeline state as a function of
other facts because the transcript has **no direct event** for it. The **litmus
test** for whether such a heuristic is legitimate:

> **Legitimate iff it is a *reversible pure function of current facts* AND it
> *fills a genuine gap* rather than overriding ground truth already in the model.**

| Heuristic | Location | Derives | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Group rollup** | `recompute_group_status` | Group status = all-children-terminal (`Failed` if any child failed) | ✅ **Textbook.** No group completion event exists; children's own terminal status *is* the ground truth; fully re-derived, reverts to `Running` when a late child appears. |
| **Time-derived liveness** | `recompute_liveness` | Agent `Running`/`Idle`/`Done` from an activity window **+ pending tool_calls** | ✅ **Legit** (as of this session). Terminal acks and pending tools — the ground truth — short-circuit it; the 120s window only fills the residual gap, reversibly. This is the one that *used* to fail the litmus. |
| **Spawn ack classification** | `resolve_spawn_status` | Whether an ack is a completion (sync) or a handle (async still running), via `last_ts > ack_ts` | ⚠️ **Mostly legit — one soft spot.** Grounded in real timestamps, but an async agent with *no own activity yet* + a spawn ack defaults to terminal `Done`. A definitive "done" from absence of evidence — the same shape as the bug we fixed, on a much rarer path. See §7. |
| **Undated-item dating** | `Timing` enum, `date_and_sort` (tailer) | Timestamps/order for **records that carry none** (Claude's sidecars and ledgers) | ✅ **Legit.** A real gap (the data genuinely has no timestamp); dated relative to dated neighbours / a leader; guarded by an order-independence property test. |
| **Prompt / era attribution** | `prompt_for_ts`, era derivation | Which prompt-era an agent or entry belongs to | ✅ **Legit.** A pure function of recorded timestamps, cross-source-arrival-order independent. No "belongs to prompt X" field exists. |

**Not this class — presentation thresholds.** `RUN_GAP` (chip grouping),
`GAP_MARKER_SECS` (gap markers), `LIVE_FRESH` (live-dot), `GLIDE_SECS` (camera),
`POLL_INTERVAL` (tailer). These derive *how things look/pace*, not model state.
Being "wrong" here tweaks a pixel or a cadence; it can never mislabel an agent or
hide an error. They are held to a comfort standard, not a correctness one.

---

## 4. Time-derived liveness (`recompute_liveness`)

The reference clock is the timeline's **`now`**: wall-clock only at a *live* edge,
the **playhead otherwise** — so a scrubbed-back or replaying view shows the
as-of-then state with no wall-clock bleed. (This is the one job of the `replay`
flag — a recording judges liveness by the playhead, since its timestamps are a
past recording unrelated to wall time; a live session by wall-clock at its edge.
See §6.)

For each agent with a `last_ts`, "active" means **within `INTERACTIVE_IDLE_SECS`
(~120s) of `now`, OR holding a pending tool_call** (§2.2). Then:

- **Interactive** (main, forks): `Running` if active, else `Idle`. Never
  `Done`/`Failed` — interactive completion is unclaimable. Reversible.
- **Subagent, `terminal`:** keep the authoritative status (§2.1). Short-circuits
  the heuristic entirely.
- **Subagent, non-terminal:** `Running` if active, else `Done` — **reversible**: a
  long gap that settled it to `Done` flips straight back to `Running` when it
  resumes (or the moment a tool goes pending).

A **replay** that reaches its end fires `end_of_stream` once, settling interactive
agents to `Idle` and still-running spawned agents to `Done` (the recording is
over; activity is provably absent). A live stream never fires it.

---

## 5. The chip system — a case study in the two clocks

Chips are the ephemeral `⚒ bash ×5` overlays under agent cards. They are the
cleanest worked example of §1.2, and were rebuilt this session into a **single
reconcile pass**.

**A chip is a *run*** — a maximal group of consecutive same-name tool calls
(`⚒ read ×N`), a range `[start, start+count)` into an agent's `tool_calls`.
Aggregation is what stops a busy agent from churning chips through the per-agent
cap: a burst of 20 reads is one counting chip, not 20 that flash past.

**One derivation each frame — `ChipTray::reconcile(dt, playing, model)`.** It
rebuilds the whole tray from model state, carrying afterglows across the rebuild
by run identity `(agent, start)`. The design splits cleanly along the two clocks:

- **Grouping is content** — a pure function of the calls' own **timestamps**
  (`within_gap`, `RUN_GAP`). Because it never consults animation history, the
  grouping is *identical on forward playback and on a seek* — which is precisely
  what let the old two paths (`observe` + `seed`) collapse into one.
- **The afterglow is presentation** — a fade that ages in **watch-time**, anchored
  when a run settles, re-anchored bright when a run gains a member (so a long burst
  doesn't sawtooth-fade mid-stream). Forward-only; not replayed on a seek.
- **Pending is content** — a run with any in-flight call shows bright and is
  **reconstructed at any playhead inside its interval**, however you scrubbed
  there. On attach/seek, `adopt_baseline` moves the `seen` mark to the end
  (absorbing completed history silently) and the next `reconcile` re-derives the
  in-flight runs from state.

**Two invariants worth their own line:**

- `RUN_GAP == CHIP_TTL` (2.5s). Once a run has been quiet long enough to fade, the
  next same-name call is also beyond the gap — so it opens a *fresh* run instead of
  **resurrecting** the faded one.
- **`seen` is the born-completed / history discriminator.** A completed run past
  the mark is new work (flash it); one below the mark is history a seek absorbed
  (don't). It is the one genuinely irreducible bit of memory — everything else is a
  pure function of state.

**Owner-liveness is `terminal`-gated.** A pending chip persists until its owner is
*authoritatively* finished — **not** on the reversible 120s-quiet `Done` (§2.2).
This is what keeps a long tool's chip alive to settle into its ✓/✗ instead of
vanishing.

---

## 6. Time-travel over one timeline

Detailed in [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md#timeline); the architectural essence:

- **Live and replay are one time-shifted model**, not two modes. One ts-ordered
  item list, one playhead. The only difference is whether the right **edge** is
  fixed (finished file) or growing (session being written). The edge is *always
  the last event*, never wall-clock now — an old session never grows an empty tail
  toward the present.
- **Pin-vs-pace is decided by the edge, not the mode.** Behind the edge the cursor
  paces forward, compressing dead air by a graded log curve (`compress_gap`, not a
  flat cap — a 5-min wait still reads longer than a 5-sec one; `s` toggles faithful
  pacing); at the edge it pins. So `space` resumes from the playhead in both modes,
  and a scrubbed-back live session catches up then follows.
- **The scrubber is event-indexed, not time-linear** — real sessions cluster work
  then idle for hours, so a time-linear bar buries the action in a sliver. The
  track is a tool-activity sparkline over event ranges.
- **Transport is emergent** (`Live`/`Playing`/`Paused`/`History`/`Idle`), read from
  edge-following + append freshness — never a hardcoded mode.

---

## 7. Known soft spots

Honest ledger of what's derived-but-imperfect, for whoever touches this next:

- **`resolve_spawn_status` no-activity → `Done`.** An async agent that has a spawn
  ack but no own activity *yet* is classified terminal `Done`. It's a definitive
  conclusion from absence of evidence — the same species as the liveness bug we
  fixed, just on a rare path (sidechain agents normally produce activity). The
  principled fix: don't default a zero-activity async agent to terminal; let
  time-derived liveness own it until real evidence arrives. Left documented, not
  yet changed.
- **Aggregate chip error-coloring.** A settled run shows a single aggregate
  ✓/✗; a run of N where only one call failed still reads as an error run. Cosmetic
  over-alarm, noted for a future pass.

---

## Appendix — the principles, distilled

1. The model is a **pure function of the fact set**, never of arrival order.
2. Derived state is **reversible**; it reverts when contradicted. Never monotonic.
3. **State ages in content-time; animation ages in presentation-time.** Never mix.
4. **Time comes from timestamped events**, never from a final/static record that
   folds early.
5. A **spawn ack is not a completion.** Completion is `terminal`, or it is derived
   and reversible.
6. A **pending tool_call is ground truth** — it outranks any quiet-time inference.
7. A heuristic is legitimate only when it is a **reversible function of current
   facts filling a real gap** — never when it overrides ground truth already in the
   model.
