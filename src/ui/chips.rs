//! Ephemeral tool-call chips — overlay decorations anchored to agent nodes.
//!
//! Chips are deliberately NOT graph nodes: they don't participate in layout,
//! fit-view bounds, the minimap, or hit testing, so they can pop and fade
//! without disturbing the graph. A chip spawns below an agent's card when a
//! tool call is observed and reads its live state (pending/✓/✗) from the model
//! at render time. Pending chips persist (they are the in-flight indicator);
//! completed ones fade from the moment completion was observed, then expire.
//! Anchoring uses `Flow::node_terminal_rect`; writes are clipped per cell with
//! `Flow::is_in_bounds` (the escape-hatch contract).
//!
//! **When a chip appears is content-timed; how long it lingers is a viewing
//! window.** A chip spawns the instant its tool folds (content-timed, automatic
//! — no clock needed). But its fade *duration* is a human-perception budget
//! (~2.5s to catch it), so it ages in **playing wall-time** (`reconcile`): real
//! time while the playhead advances, frozen when paused or scrubbed. This is
//! deliberately NOT media-time — under gap-compression the playhead fast-
//! forwards through dead air, and a media-time afterglow would be raced to zero
//! mid-gap (a run flickering out just before the next cluster extends it). A
//! bounded gap-crossing (log-compressed to ~2s) is shorter than the TTL, so the
//! run survives the gap and keeps aggregating; a genuinely long pause still
//! fades it. Aggregation (runs, below) is what makes a wall-time afterglow
//! churn-free at any speed. Chrome (camera glide, marching ants) also uses
//! wall-time; only the playhead itself is media-timed.
//!
//! `reconcile`: ChipTray::reconcile
