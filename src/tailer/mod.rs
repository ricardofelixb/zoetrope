//! Background task: live tailing and replay assembly.
//!
//! A single tailer task owns ALL files of the watched session. It is poll-based
//! (200 ms interval, no `notify` dep): each tick it stats every tracked file,
//! reads appended bytes, splits on `\n`, parses complete lines, and buffers the
//! trailing partial. It asks the session for files that appeared since
//! ([`Session::rescan`](crate::provider::Session::rescan)) each tick. Replay
//! parses everything up front, merges by timestamp, and hands the App the
//! whole stream.
//!
//! Everything is stamped with `session_id`; the UI drops events whose session
//! id is not current (see [`crate::state::App::is_current`]).
//!
//! The feeders know nothing about any format. A [`Target`] goes into
//! [`provider::open`](crate::provider::open), a
//! [`Session`](crate::provider::Session) comes out with a
//! [`Stream`](crate::provider::Stream) per file, and lines go through it.
//!
//! Layout: this module holds the task entry (`run`) and the shared wire types
//! ([`TailRequest`] / [`UiEvent`]); `bytes` is the
//! pure incremental reader, `live` the live poll loop, `replay` the up-front
//! assembly. Both feeders converge on `live::tail_loop` so every session keeps
//! tailing.
